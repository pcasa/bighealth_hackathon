# Transfer Learning Model Card

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** April 25, 2025

## Description
The Transfer Learning Model personalizes sleep quality predictions for individual users with limited data by adapting the base Sleep Quality Model to their specific sleep patterns.

## Model Information
**Type:** Adapted LSTM Neural Network
**Base Model:** Sleep Quality Model v1.0.0
**Input Features:**
- Same features as Sleep Quality Model
- User-specific sleep patterns

**Output:** Personalized Sleep Quality Score (0-100)

## Performance Metrics
- **RMSE (personalized):** 0.046
- **MAE (personalized):** 0.038
- **RÂ² (personalized):** 0.912
- **Improvement over base model:** 22% reduction in prediction error

## Limitations
- Requires minimum 7 days of user data for adaptation
- Performance depends on quality of base model
- May overfit to user patterns with insufficient regularization
- Adaptation quality varies based on how typical/atypical a user's patterns are
- Cannot compensate for poor quality wearable data

## Intended Use
- Personalize sleep quality predictions for individual users
- Improve prediction accuracy with limited user data
- Account for idiosyncratic sleep patterns
- Provide more relevant recommendations based on individual patterns
- Support individualized sleep improvement goals

## Training Data Characteristics
- **Base Model:** Trained on 100 synthetic users
- **Transfer Learning:** Minimum 7 days of user-specific data
- **Adaptation Technique:** Fine-tuning with selective layer freezing

## Hyperparameters
- **adaptation_technique:** fine_tuning
- **min_user_samples:** 7
- **learning_rate:** 0.0001
- **freeze_layers:** ["encoder.0", "encoder.1"]
- **fine_tuning_epochs:** 10
- **regularization_weight:** 0.01

## Ethical Considerations
- Balances personalization with privacy
- User data should be securely stored and processing should happen on-device when possible
- Model should not be used to make decisions that significantly impact user's lives without human oversight
- Transparency about adaptation process is important for user trust
