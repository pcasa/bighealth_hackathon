# Data Drift Detector Card

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** April 25, 2025

## Description
The Data Drift Detector monitors input data distributions to identify shifts that might affect model performance over time. It uses both univariate and multivariate statistical methods to detect significant changes in feature distributions.

## Component Information
**Type:** Model Monitoring System
**Monitored Features:** All features used by Sleep Quality Model
**Detection Methods:**
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (univariate)
- Chi-Square test (univariate)
- PCA Reconstruction Error (multivariate)
- Maximum Mean Discrepancy (multivariate)

**Output:** Drift Score (0-1), Feature Importance, Drift Reports

## Performance Characteristics
- **False Positive Rate:** 0.05 (5% chance of alerting when no drift exists)
- **Detection Sensitivity:** Can detect ~10% shift in feature distributions
- **Monitoring Frequency:** Daily

## Limitations
- Statistical tests assume specific distribution characteristics
- May be less sensitive to subtle, gradual changes
- Requires sufficient sample size for reliable detection
- Cannot distinguish between benign and harmful drift
- Alert thresholds require tuning based on domain knowledge

## Intended Use
- Monitor production data for distribution shifts
- Alert when significant drift is detected
- Identify which features are contributing most to drift
- Support model retraining decisions
- Track data quality over time

## Reference Data Characteristics
- Based on training data distribution
- Updates periodically to accommodate expected seasonal variations
- Preserves privacy by storing statistical summaries rather than raw data

## Configuration Parameters
- **drift_score_threshold:** 0.7
- **feature_importance_threshold:** 0.8
- **univariate_methods:** ["ks_test", "chi_square"]
- **multivariate_methods:** ["pca_reconstruction", "mmd"]
- **monitoring_frequency:** "daily"

## Operational Considerations
- Designed to be part of an automated MLOps pipeline
- Generates detailed drift reports for analysis
- Should trigger manual review when high drift scores are detected
- May incorporate domain knowledge through configurable thresholds
- Supports visualization of drift metrics for easier interpretation
