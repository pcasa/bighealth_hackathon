  ]
}
```

## Primary Prediction Targets
- **sleep_efficiency**: Ratio of time asleep to time in bed (0-1)
- **sleep_score**: Comprehensive score of sleep quality (0-100)
- **anomaly_detection**: Detection of unusual sleep patterns compared to user baseline

## Future Predictions
- **next_night_efficiency**: Predicted sleep efficiency for the following night
- **optimal_bedtime**: Recommended bedtime for maximizing sleep quality
- **optimal_waketime**: Recommended wake time for maximizing sleep quality
- **trend_prediction**: Expected improvement, stability, or decline in sleep quality
- **prediction_horizon**: 1-7 days depending on data quality and consistency

## Sleep Pattern Classification
The model can detect the following sleep patterns:
- Normal Sleeper Pattern
- Insomnia Pattern
- Shift Worker Pattern
- Oversleeper Pattern
- Highly Variable Sleeper

**Classification method**: Combination of neural network analysis and rule-based detection

## Prediction Confidence Scoring
Confidence range: Confidence scores from 0.1 (low) to 0.95 (high)

Factors affecting confidence:
- Amount of available historical data
- Consistency of sleep patterns
- Quality of input data
- Pattern type (insomnia patterns have lower confidence)
- Data completeness (more metrics = higher confidence)

## Demographic Analysis Capabilities
Dimensions analyzed:
- Age Group Analysis
- Profession Category Analysis
- Geographic Region Analysis
- Seasonal Pattern Analysis

Analysis types:
- Cross-sectional comparisons
- Trend analysis over time
- Impact assessment by demographic factor

## Performance Metrics
- mse: 0.05625797435641289
- rmse: 0.23718763533627313
- features: ['sleep_duration_hours', 'sleep_efficiency', 'awakenings_count', 'total_awake_minutes', 'deep_sleep_percentage', 'rem_sleep_percentage', 'sleep_onset_latency_minutes', 'heart_rate_variability', 'average_heart_rate', 'age_normalized', 'profession_healthcare', 'profession_tech', 'profession_service', 'profession_education', 'profession_office', 'profession_other', 'season_Winter', 'season_Spring', 'season_Summer', 'season_Fall', 'light_sleep_percentage', 'blood_oxygen']

## Limitations
- Requires at least 7 days of consecutive sleep data for sequence-based predictions
- May not be accurate for users with highly irregular sleep patterns
- Not clinically validated for sleep disorder diagnosis
- Confidence decreases with sparse or inconsistent data
- Transfer learning adaptation needed for users with limited data

## Ethical Considerations
- Should not be used as the sole basis for medical decisions
- Privacy considerations for handling sensitive sleep data
- Potential bias in demographic analysis due to training data distribution

## Maintenance
- recommended_retraining_frequency: Every 3 months with new data
- data_drift_monitoring: Implemented to detect changes in feature distributions

## Detailed Predictive Capabilities

### Sleep Quality Predictions
- Sleep efficiency trends over time based on user-reported data
- Probability of experiencing insomnia on upcoming nights
- Estimated sleep quality for the coming night based on recent patterns
- Expected subjective ratings if certain behaviors are modified

### Pattern Recognition
- Sleep consistency patterns and how they affect overall sleep quality
- Identification of insomnia triggers based on correlations in the data
- Detection of severe insomnia episodes before they become chronic
- Recognition of improvement trends even when subjective perception lags

### Personalized Insights
- Most effective sleep window based on recorded sleep efficiency data
- Optimal bedtime and wake time for maximum sleep quality
- Personal threshold for sleep onset latency that predicts a good night's sleep
- Impact of awakenings on overall sleep quality for the individual

### Behavior Impact Assessment
- Expected improvement if sleep consistency is increased
- Predicted benefits of reducing time in bed for those with extended wake times
- Forecasted sleep efficiency changes with various interventions
- Projected recovery time after periods of severe insomnia

### Long-term Predictions
- Risk of developing chronic insomnia based on current patterns
- Expected timeline for improvement with consistent sleep practices
- Likelihood of relapse based on pattern recognition
- Long-term sleep health trajectory with and without intervention
