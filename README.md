## Project Overview

Sleep Insights App processes two main data sources:
1. Base sleep information input by users (bedtime, wake time, sleep quality ratings, etc.)
2. Sleep and health data from wearable devices (Apple Watch, Google Watch, Fitbit, Samsung Watch)

The application:
- Calculates a sleep score based on multiple factors
- Identifies patterns and trends in sleep behavior
- Detects anomalies in sleep patterns
- Provides personalized recommendations
- Analyzes sleep cycles and quality
- Correlates external factors with sleep quality

## Core Data Structures

### User Profile

- Additional metrics (depending on device):
  - Blood oxygen levels
  - Respiration rate
  - Skin temperature

## Sleep Pattern Variations

The system models several sleep pattern types:

### Normal Sleeper Pattern
- Sleep onset within 10-20 minutes of attempting sleep
- 7-8 hours total sleep
- 1-2 brief awakenings
- Consistent bedtime and wake time (Â±30 min)
- Regular sleep stages with normal proportions
- Sleep efficiency 85-95%

### Insomnia Pattern
- Extended sleep onset (30+ minutes)
- Frequent awakenings (3-7 per night)
- Longer wake periods during the night (10-60+ minutes)
- Reduced total sleep time (4-6 hours)
- Higher heart rate during attempted sleep
- Lower proportion of deep sleep
- Sleep efficiency 60-80%
- Subjective ratings often lower than objective measurements

### Shift Worker Pattern
- Sleep during daytime hours
- More fragmented sleep
- Shorter total duration (5-7 hours)
- Less consistent day-to-day timing
- Reduced REM and deep sleep proportions
- Higher heart rate during sleep
- Sleep efficiency 70-85%

### Oversleeper Pattern
- Extended time in bed (9-11 hours)
- Longer than average total sleep time
- Normal or slightly lower sleep efficiency
- Potentially more REM sleep in later sleep cycles
- Lower average heart rate during sleep

### Highly Variable Sleeper
- Inconsistent bed and wake times (varies by 1-3 hours)
- Variable sleep duration night to night
- Fluctuating sleep quality
- Inconsistent sleep stage distribution
- More irregular heart rate patterns during sleep

### Device-Specific Variation Factors
- Different sampling rates for heart rate
- Varying sensitivity in movement detection
- Different sleep stage classification algorithms
- Precision differences in sleep onset detection

# Sleep Insights App - Recommendation System

The Sleep Insights App includes a personalized recommendation system that analyzes sleep patterns from user-submitted form data and provides tailored guidance to help users improve their sleep quality.

## Form Data Collection

Our system primarily relies on daily sleep form submissions that capture:

- Time the user went to bed
- Time the user attempted to fall asleep
- Number of awakenings during the night
- Time spent awake during the night
- Wake-up time
- Time the user got out of bed
- Subjective sleep quality rating (1-10)
- Whether the user slept at all (for severe insomnia tracking)

This user-reported data provides valuable insights without requiring wearable devices, making the app accessible to all users.

## Recommendation Features

### Progress Tracking
- Analyzes sleep efficiency trends over time
- Identifies improvement and regression patterns
- Calculates consistency in sleep timing and tracking
- Detects severe insomnia patterns (multiple nights without sleep)

### Personalized Messaging
- Adapts message tone based on user's progress
- Provides encouragement during regression periods
- Celebrates improvements and achievements
- Offers actionable suggestions relevant to detected patterns
- Provides specialized support for severe insomnia cases

### Varied Content
- Maintains engagement by avoiding repetitive messages
- References specific sleep metrics to provide context
- Progressively introduces sleep hygiene concepts

## How Recommendations Work

The recommendation engine follows this process:

1. **Data Collection**: Sleep form data is submitted by users
2. **Data Processing**: The system preprocesses and normalizes the form data
3. **Progress Analysis**: Recent sleep trends are analyzed (typically 7-14 days)
4. **Pattern Identification**: Sleep patterns and consistency are evaluated
5. **Message Selection**: An appropriate recommendation is selected based on:
   - Current sleep trend (improving, regressing, stable)
   - Presence of no-sleep nights (severe insomnia detection)
   - User's tracking consistency
   - Previously sent messages (to avoid repetition)
6. **Personalization**: The message is personalized with the user's specific metrics
7. **Delivery**: Recommendations are delivered through the user interface

## Sample Recommendations

Different messages are provided based on the user's current status:

**For Improving Sleep:**
> "Fantastic progress! Your self-reported sleep quality has improved to 7/10. Whatever you're doing is working - keep it up!"

**For Regressing Sleep:**
> "We all have ups and downs with sleep. Your recent ratings show a temporary dip, but remember you've achieved better sleep before! Consider returning to the habits that worked well previously."

**For Sleepless Nights:**
> "You've reported 3 nights without sleep recently. This is a significant pattern that deserves professional attention - please consider consulting with a healthcare provider specializing in sleep."

## Integration with n8n

The recommendation system integrates with n8n workflows to:
1. Process incoming sleep form submissions
2. Store the data in a centralized repository
3. Generate recommendations
4. Deliver recommendations through preferred channels

## Configuration

The recommendation system can be configured through:
- `config/recommendations_config.yaml`: General settings for analysis and delivery
- `config/message_templates.json`: The library of recommendation messages

## Using the Recommendation API

To generate recommendations programmatically:

```python
from src.models.recommendation_engine import SleepRecommendationEngine

# Initialize the engine
recommendation_engine = SleepRecommendationEngine()

# Analyze a user's progress
progress_data = recommendation_engine.analyze_progress(user_id, sleep_data)

# Generate a personalized recommendation
message = recommendation_engine.generate_recommendation(user_id, progress_data)

```
